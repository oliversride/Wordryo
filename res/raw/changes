<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 60 release</b>

<h3>New with this release</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Allow alternate spellings for tiles in the Find field in the
  wordlist browser, e.g. 'a' for 'A' and 'L-L' for 'L&middot;L' (in
  Catalan). The new wordlist format requires this upgrade, so I will
  wait a few weeks before releasing new wordlists. </li>

  <li>Upgrade built-in English wordlists.</li>

  <li>Don&apos;t run SMSService if play via SSM is disabled</li>

  <li>Fix bug with invites to SMS games where invitee is missing
    wordlist</li> 
</ul>

<h3>Next up</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Improve communication with relay</li>
</ul>

<p>(The full changelog 
is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
